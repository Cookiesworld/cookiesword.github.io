I thought in the age of the portfolio software developer I better join the trend and start creating a portfolio site. I ran across [git hub pages](https://pages.github.com) which allows the creation of a site via git hub without any hosting costs.

I plan on moving some content from my old html site over here, as they say in the 90s site is under construction :)
