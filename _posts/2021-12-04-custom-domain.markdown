I have held the domain cookieswork.co.uk for years without doing much with it so I decided it would be good to setup a custom domain for these github pages. I started by following the steps in [githubs documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site#configuring-a-subdomain)
