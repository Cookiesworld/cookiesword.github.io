I have been trying to learn react for a while. I found it hard moving from Angular to React as to me everything seems the wrong way round. However it seems that I am making progress from novice to profecient. My Building Web Applications With React IQ is 101—that’s better than 20% of my peers! What's your #PluralsightIQ? https://app.pluralsight.com/score/redir/e16c9cdb-8d37-4f4c-b015-a6cb6f7ecc91?3ab6833669

Pluralsight is a great way to learn software development there are loads of courses on all sort of subjects. Some are very specific others more generic. There are even skill paths to follow to do courses to become expert in partililar skill areas.
