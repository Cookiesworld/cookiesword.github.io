A long time ago I had a personal website which I self hosted on a server I co located in a datacentre. I ended up hosting quite a few different websites and had what could be referred to as a side hustle. As time when on the cost of hosting went up while the expectation of what was free in terms of bandwidth increased. By 2019 it no longer made financial sense to continue so I migrated customers away to google and azure.

All that meant that my old site dissapeared from the web. Ive had a few free hours so I decided to try and resurrect it from a backup in Azure. The site is a PHP / HTML with a coppermine album. My longterm plan is to migrate the content to cheaper services, utilise storeage accounts rather than use a Virtual Machine. However first step is to get it up and running.

### Spin up a virtual machine on Azure.

### Install software

### Configure everything

### Sort out the DNS
