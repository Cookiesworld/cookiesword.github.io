I updated my [wordle helper](https://wh.azurewebsites.net) to add in the ability to select known letters at position elements. Using indexOf to test if the letter is contained at that position.

I also added application insights which will allow me to track errors via the application error boundary checking. It also give insights into sessions and users.
