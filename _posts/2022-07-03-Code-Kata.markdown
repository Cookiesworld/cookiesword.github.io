It has been a long time since I last did a [code kata](http://codekata.com). So long that it made me jump when I stumbled across an old code kata project while searching for something on the hard drive of my old pc. This particiular project was an attempt to produce an integer to Roman Numeral converter. Originally writen in .Net Framework 4.5 a simple class with a convert method and a sereis of tests using MS Test.

First thing first I put committed the entire project to github rather than just living on my hard disk. 

Next up I upgraded the project to .net 5.0 (I would have used 6 but I only have Visual Studio 2019 installed on this computer). 
To do this I did the following.

1. Remove the 'packages.config' file. .net core no longer uses packages. I didnt have anything special installed so this was safe to delete.
2. Upgrade project files.
```
dotnet new classlib -n RomanNumerals --force
dotnet new xUnit -n RomanNumerals.Test --force
```
This created new project files over the top of the old ones.

3. Convert the MS Test Tests into one xUnit facts. This enabled me to replace a series of test into one theory with inline data infintately more readable!
4. Add a github action to build the project and run the tests on commits to master.
