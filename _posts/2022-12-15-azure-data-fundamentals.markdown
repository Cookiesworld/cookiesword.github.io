# Azure data fundamentals

This afternoon I took and passed the Azure data fundamentals exam. This demonstrates the basics about data in azure and which solutions to use in different scenarios. 

I did the free Azure data fundamentals course on [Microsoft Virtual Training days](https://mvtd.events.microsoft.com), and they gave me the chance to take the exam for free, thanks Microsoft!
