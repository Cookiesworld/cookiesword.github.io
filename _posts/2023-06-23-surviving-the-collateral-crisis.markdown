# Surviving the collateral crisis

Yesterday evening I spoke at Insight Investments new meetup. Myself and Adam presented a case story about the Collaterals teams involement in the Collateral Crisis last September.

I created a slide deck based on the experience of the team both anecdotal and system data. Adam did the bulk of the presentation, while I did a section on the team structure.

There was some really good engagement, with a lot of questions and interaction with the audience.

Unfortunately I am unable to post the slide deck here contact me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jdcooke/) or join one of our upcoming meetups.
